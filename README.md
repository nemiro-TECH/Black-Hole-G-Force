# Black-Hole-G-Force

Written in Fortran for Educational Purposes only,

I wasn't able to recover the final program files, but I'm posting this draft to share.

Some errors still occur during compilation, but I haven't coded with fortran in years and don't have time to fix them right now.

This code is not under permanent maintenance. If you chose to fix the build errors, make a pull request and push it to the master branch.
